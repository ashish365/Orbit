# React + TypeScript + Vite

# Key Milestones

1. I have made a small task manager SPA using React with Typescript which lists tasks.
2. User can create, delete and modifiy exisiting tasks.
3. User can filter and sort tasks based on Id, priority, status. Filter by taks title can also be done.
4. There is a reset filter button which i created inorder to reset the active filters and sorting.
5. There is a Pagination fetaure implementeed to have paginated view of the tasks in the table.
6. Data is being persisted locally, so whatever change the user will do will persist across different tabs and window.
7. New Custom fields can be added to the task table. You can console log filteredTask state to see the metadata of tasks after adding custom fields.

# Bonus Milestones

1. I have implemented a loader on CRUD operations of the tasks.
2. I have provided UNDO/REDO functionality for task addition, modification and deletion which is also locally persisted.

NOTE - I have made use of Material ui icons wherever needed and RingLoader component from "react-spinners" library. I haven't made use of any material UI components like grid, table, inputs etc. EVerything is being made using HTML tags.
